# AI-Python---Create-Own-Image-Classifier

Create-Your-Own-Image-Classifier NoteBook file. 
This is Project 2 of Udacity's 'AI Programming with Python' Nanodegree. This required to create an ImageClassifier program in Notebook.
The other required files were to create separate command line files train.py and predict.py

In this project, the Python application required it to train an image classifier on a  pre-trained dataset and then predict new images using the trained model. These two files are command line. The ImageClassifier runs 30 epochs and the Train.py runs 20 epochs for training. The epoch is a pass or one iteration for training.
