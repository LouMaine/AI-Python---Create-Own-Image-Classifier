# AI-Python---Create-Own-Image-Classifier

Create-Your-Own-Image-Classifier NoteBook file
This is Project 2 part of Udacity's 'AI Programming with Python' Nanodegree. This required to create an ImageClassifier program in Notebook.
The other required files were to create a separate command line files train.py and predict.py

In this project, the Python application required it to train an image classifier on a  pre-trained dataset and then predict new images
using the trained mode.
